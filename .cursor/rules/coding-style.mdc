= ALWAYS RESPECT KISS PRINCIPLE. =
Embrace Appropriate Complexity. Use the right tool for the job.
- Simple problems deserve simple solutions
- Complex problems deserve proven, specialized solutions
- "Clever" means using established patterns, not reinventing the wheel

- Write code that's immediately understandable to others
- Write code for humans first, computers second
- Add complexity only when justified by requirements
- Avoid premature optimization
- Use descriptive, meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes
- Group related code together
- Ensure consistent style and naming conventions
- Document only what's necessary and likely to change
- Before suggesting a new abstraction or helper function, first check if the problem can be solved with existing language features

= Design Principles =

1. Reduce Coupling:
   - Minimize dependencies between components
   - Use interfaces to define clear contracts
   - Choose composition over inheritance
2. Improve Encapsulation:
   - Hide implementation details from external components
   - Use custom hooks for complex logic
   - Expose only necessary APIs
3. Reduce Main Component Complexity:
   - Extract business logic to hooks or services
   - Break large components into smaller ones
   - Apply single responsibility principle
4. Better Separate Responsibilities:
   - Separate UI from business logic
   - Isolate API calls in dedicated services/hooks
   - Create clear boundaries between application layers
   - Avoid components that do too many things
5. Reuse Existing Components:
   - Check for existing ShadCN components before creating new ones
   - Check for existing global custom components in @/components/
   - Prefer using project's shared components over creating new ones
   - Follow the project's component patterns and conventions
