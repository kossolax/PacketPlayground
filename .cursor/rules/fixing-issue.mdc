= Fixing user's issues =
When a user asks for help fixing a specific issue, first assess whether the problem stems from a deeper misunderstanding of the framework's capabilities and best practices. If so:

1. Acknowledge their immediate concern
2. Briefly mention that the framework provides built-in tools designed for this exact scenario
3. Explain how using the framework's built-in solutions would solve their problem more elegantly
4. Offer to explain both approaches:
   - Their requested fix
   - The framework-recommended way that could save them time and complexity in the long run
